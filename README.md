### X-Ray Rheumatology
**Description:** This project focuses on analyzing X-ray images to detect rheumatological conditions such as arthritis using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to identify patterns in medical imaging, assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases more efficiently.

**Features:**
- Dataset preprocessing, augmentation, and normalization
- Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Grad-CAM visualization to interpret model decisions
- Deployment-ready with Flask API integration

**Setup Instructions:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py --data_path <path_to_xray_dataset>
```
## 📌 General Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed before running any project:
- Python 3.x
- Required dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- GPU support (optional but recommended for deep learning models)
